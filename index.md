# Welcome to our home!
This is a short collection of things you might need / want to know about the house. It’s worth a quick read. We hope you’ll have a comfortable and pleasant stay.
## Kitchen
The cooker has a gas hob and two ovens. The right hand one (as you look at it) is a fan oven and the one we use most often. The extractor fan has lost it’s knob to turn it on but can be easily be switched on manually. 
The dishwasher is fairly self explanatory (instructions at the back of the folder if required). However the little drawer for the tablets has stopped working and doesn’t open whilst it’s washing, we get around this by dropping the tablet at the bottom of the dishwasher before starting the cycle. The washing tabs are in the cupboard under the sink.
The bin is to the right of the dishwasher. The front is for landfill and the back is for recycling. We try and recycle when we can and you can put in paper, cardboard, plastic and glass but try and rinse anything that goes in the recycling. When full the main bins are in the garage by the door – Green for recycling and brown for landfill. They are collected on alternative Wednesday mornings the dates are on the wall behind the bins. You will need to put them at the top of the drive on Tuesday night as the bin men won’t come onto property to get them. If you forget, don’t worry, we will sort them out when we get back.
The microwave is fairly straightforward to use but the start button can stick, a bit of a wiggle and it will start.
Help yourself to tea / coffee / herbs / oils etc.. Regarding food, we don’t mind you using anything you need to from the fridge or freezer but would ask you to replace any major food items or if you use a lot.
The toaster will toast up to 4 pieces of bread but you need to push down the right hand lever before the left hand one will work.
Cleaning materials / bin bags are in the cupboard under the sink.
There is a dog flap in the back door which we have put the cover over. The lights on top of the cupboard will come on in the morning  and evening, feel free to adjust the timer by the toaster or turn them off altogether.


## Dining Room
Tablecloths / runners etc are in the right hand side of the sideboard.  We have left some mats on the table.
We’re happy for you to borrow books from here or the living room but just ask you to look after them and leave them when you go.
Also feel free to play any of the games you find here, in the living room or in Emily’s room.

## Utility room / downstairs WC
The washing machine is a standard model. We usually wash everything on setting 3. You will need to set the dial to the top and then to the setting you want each time. We use wash gel pouches that go in the machine with the washing and the softener goes in the drawer on the top left, there are some pouches in the sink drawer so if you need to wash anything do help yourself. There is a tumble dryer in the garage (immediately on the left as you go in). It collects water in the tray at the top which needs to be emptied every other time used, and de-fluffed by removing the little plastic filter at the bottom of the door.
The iron and ironing board are in the garage, the board is immediately on the right as you enter and the iron on the left.
The vacuum cleaner is kept in the garage, immediately on the right as you enter. There is also a cordless one hanging on the left which is good enough to do a quick zip around the whole house (a charge lasts 8 mins) There is also a mop and bucket if you need it and we have recently purchase a steam mop which you can use.
Garage
The main things you should need in the garage are the bins, the tumble dryer, ironing board and vacuum cleaner and maybe the kayak if you are planning to take that out.  We use the garage as a bit of a dumping ground so apologies about the clutter! The garage door is electric and can be opened from the inside by pressing the red button in the arm mechanism above your head. We only open the garage from the inside as we no longer have the external controls. You have time to set it to close and walk out the front way if required. If you need to cut the water off for any reason the stop cock (tap) is hidden low down behind the bins. Light bulbs can be found in one of the top cupboards and if for any reason you need tools they can be found on the side. We also have bodyboards that you can use if you are lucky enough to have good weather, and if you can fit into them you can also use the wetsuits as long as they are rinsed out after use and hung to dry inside the garage. The light in the garage comes on automatically but if you need to put it on permanently the switch is over by the bins. 


## Lounge
We have Freesat TV which has all freeview channels plus a few others. There are also interactive channels such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available. There are always a lot of programmes recorded on there for us to find time to watch so please don’t delete any of them if you can help it but if multiple things are recording and preventing you watching what you want, feel free to cancel. The TV is switched on/off by a button on the bottom left hand side. ON turning it on, you may get it go into standby mode (a red light showing). If so, press the TV button on the remote and then hold the power button on the white remote until the standby light goes green. Once the TV you may need to turn on the Freesat box as well, press the STB button on the white remote the the power button. Once the STB button has been pressed all remote functions are accessible and you only need to press the TV button to turn the TV off.
Any issues with the box may just require it to be turned off and on again.
The fire in the lounge is an electric one. We rarely use it but if you need to then do. You can move the bottom part of the fire out to access the controls. It isn’t the best but we find the central heating is normally enough. There is a small black remote control which you can use to turn on the back light of the fire but you need to be quite close to the fire for it to work.
You can have access to our wifi (although you will need your own device). If you want access the network name is jagohome and the password will be in the homebook. We have a printer we rarely use which you can use if you wish. Very occasionally the router will lose connection, if this happens simply unplug the router behind the TV for a few seconds, reconnect and it should sort itself out.

## Hallway
The fusebox is in a little cupboard by the stairs. Occasionally a blown light bulb will trip a switch, you should simply be able to flick the switch back up and carry on.



## Upstairs
Upstairs we have two double bedrooms and two singles. There is a family bathroom with a shower and bath and an ensuite off the main bedroom. Emily is happy to share all her toys but asks for them to be looked after. 
There is clean bedding on all the beds and we have left spare bedding for all on the single bed. If more is needed there is some in the plastic containers under the bed in the main bedroom.
We have left clean towels on the beds and in the bathroom. If more are required they are located in the guest double bedroom. Feel free to take towels out of the house to the beach if you need to. 

## Outside
To the front the drive is fairly steep so please do watch small children. We have never had a problem with parking on there so please don’t be nervous about that. To the rear we have a trampoline which is fun for all the family.. The shed in the bottom of the garden has some children’s play equipment in and a small bbq (if you are lucky enough to come here when the sun is shining!). There is usually charcoal there in the bottom drawer and if so you are free to use it. Be careful opening the garage and only use the right hand door, the storms also managed to blow in both the doors this winter! The cushion for the swing will can be found in the plastic container on the patio. 
The patio light switches can be found just inside the kitchen door, only the right two switches are used. Also all the garden lights can be turned on with the grey switch on the outside wall.
Miscellaneous
Please feel free to use whatever you need in the house and to take out (rugs / bags etc).
We are on a water meter and the cost of water in the South West is very high so we would be grateful if you could be sensible about what water you are using while staying in our home (e.g. not leaving taps running etc).
We usually turn off our heating during summer months, putting it back on around October. If you need to use it then you can find the boiler in the utility room and manually override the settings. There is a small switch in the circular dial which has 3 settings, 0 for off, the middle setting for timer (controlled by pushing in the little switches around the edge and 1 for on permanently. As with everything I am sure you will be mindful of our utility bills and use this sensibly.
Our home insurance is with Liverpool Victoria and covers home exchanges, although not expensive items. It also includes accidental damage. If anything serious happens while you are staying in our home which you think we need to know about then please try and contact us ( 0789 792338 or 07818 054472) or Linda & Bill Jago (Spencer’s parents) on 01752 816596 / 07939 412471 / 07951 905700 who should be able to help you. If required, our policy number documents will be accessible. 
Please just collect any post that comes and pile it somewhere we will see it when we come home.
Keys, you will have found are in the locked box by the front door. Please put them back in there when you leave – or if you have any problems with that post them through the letterbox (out of sight if possible). All other keys are in the doors. The windows are all lockable.
We have some redundant light switches, particularly in the kitchen so I have put a sticker on the ones you will probably want to use!

## Neighbours
Our neighbours are very friendly and would be happy to help you if you needed them to. As you look at the house, on the right are Kevin and Nancy and on the left Martyn and Tracy and their young sons, Tyler and Adam. Kevin and Nancy do hold a key for us in an emergency and are also very happy to give you any advice about the local area.
