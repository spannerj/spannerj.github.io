## Getting Out and About

There’s loads to do in this area. We’ve listed some of the things that we’ve done and really enjoyed and some things that we have heard are good. There some leaflets here so these are just a few ideas based on things we have experienced.
Here are some main routes from the house. It’s just a few to get started and get your bearings. We suggest using a sat nav if you have one, it will make life a lot easier although signposts around the area are pretty good.
From the house either:
Turn left at the end of the street, then right then left up a street with large semi detached period houses on both sides. At the main road junction turn left (onto Mannamead road) and follow this until it takes you to the main Mannamead roundabout. You can either take the exit to Cornwall (signposted Liskeard) which takes you over the Tamar bridge, the exit signposted Tavistock which will take you up onto the moors, or the exit signposted Exeter which will take you towards many Devon attractions.

Turn right at the end of the street, following the road down the hill bearing left. At the bottom turn right then left onto the busier road and follow the signs into the city centre. The centre, Barbican and the Hoe are all signposted as are numerous car parks. It should take about 10-15 minutes to drive to the Hoe.

Another route to Cornwall is to take the Torpoint Ferry. Follow the instructions above until the busier road junction and then go right until you get to the main road (Outland Road). Turn left and follow the signs to the Torpoint Ferry. You will drive past Plymouth Argyle football ground and through a small city village called Stoke. It’s about 10 minutes drive to the ferry. You won’t need to pay going into Cornwall but it will cost £1.50 to come out again! That goes for the Tamar bridge too.

To get the rail station we suggest you take a taxi. It’s only a 5 minute ride and will be cheaper than paying for parking at the station.  There are some taxi numbers included in the useful contacts section. This is a mainline station and you can get trains from here to many main destinations as well as more local services into Devon and Cornwall. If you did want to drive to the station then we suggest getting onto Outland Road and following the signs to the railway station. 

Similarly if you are having an evening in Plymouth, a taxi costs about £6-8 depending on where you go and is a popular method of travel for locals.

There are bus stops at the bottom on the hill that will take you into the city centre and beyond. The main bus station is in Plymouth centre and there you can catch buses all over both Devon and Cornwall. It’s advisable to check out times of buses to rural areas before travelling.


### Some ideas for sightseeing / days out / activities

I haven’t included directions for these places but we have leaflets for lots of them in the folder. Most can be easily googled! We have listed them in relation to travelling distance (driving) but in peak season don’t hold us to this!  
There are so many more places than this – these are just a few ideas.
I have listed some places that are suited to youngish children separately – that’s not to say everyone wouldn’t enjoy them!
Walking 10-15 minutes
Central Park – at the bottom of the hill from our house (you can see it from the house). Great for a walk close by.
Plymouth Life Centre – large building you can see from the house in the park. Olympic pool, children’s pool, diving pool, excellent climbing wall, gym etc.
Hyde Park corner – selection of boutique shops and a few cafes. Down the hill and turn left onto the busier road. Follow that down.
Mutley Plain – bars, cafes and shops – some smaller supermarkets (and a lot of estate agents!). Very popular student area. Our favourite pub ‘The Hyde Park’ which sits on the roundabout at the start of Mutley Plain does great and cheapish pub food. 

##### For kids
Central Park has a large children’s playground – by the life centre.

### Driving 10-15 minutes

Plymouth Barbican and Hoe – a must for any visit to Plymouth. Lots of small cafes and bars where you can enjoy the wonderful views. There are many of restaurants on the barbican and Hoe. Booking often advisable at weekends.

Take a picnic and just go for a walk or lunch at the Edgecombe Arms (again book at weekends..)

There are so many places you could reach in 2 hours, far too many to list. For Cornwall you could get to Lands End (combine this with a trip to Porthcurno beach and the outdoor Minak Theatre) or go to the very picturesque St Ives. Another amazing Cornish beach is Sennen Cove and there’s St Michaels Mount at Marazion.  You could also reach North Devon which has some beautiful beaches - Bude and Widemouth are amazing. 

### Places to eat - Plymouth

Barbican – many restaurants to choose from – many different nationalities and styles.

Royal William Yard – newly developed historical site in beautiful setting – numerous restaurants.

City Centre – numerous – there is a concentration of them near / along Royal Parade.

Rhodes@the Dome – Plymouth Hoe new Gary Rhodes restaurant – you will probably need to book.

Many others around Plymouth and surrounding areas – google it!

### Places to drink

Plymouth Barbican has the highest concentration of bars, many of which you can sit out. I would avoid this outside area later on a Saturday night unless you like it quite lively.

Mutley Plain is walking distance from the house with numerous public houses. Very studenty.

Numerous pubs around Plymouth.

Lots of country pubs around. You can barely drive a few miles without coming across one.

Avoid Union Street.


### Places to dance

There are a number of nightclubs but I’m afraid we are a bit out of touch! The best thing to do is to go to a local bar and ask someone. Most are around Plymouth Barbican area.
